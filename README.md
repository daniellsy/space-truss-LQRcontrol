# space_truss_finite_element
Code of a *space truss* modal use finite **element method**
the truss is defined by the **length** and **width** of each truss block,the **rou/E/A** of *rod* .etc
==to control the vibration of the space truss,we use PZT piezoelectricity matetial with LQR control method==
